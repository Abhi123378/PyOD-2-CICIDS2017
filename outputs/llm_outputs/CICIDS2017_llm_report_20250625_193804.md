# LLM Analysis & Model Recommendation for CICIDS2017 Dataset

## Overview Summary for CICIDS2017
The CICIDS2017 dataset is a large-scale, medium-dimensional dataset with 9780 samples and 67 features. It has a high degree of imbalance with an anomaly ratio of 18.5%. The dataset is clean with no missing values and has a high degree of skewness and kurtosis, making it a challenging dataset for anomaly detection.

## Comparison of Symbolic vs. Actual Scores
The symbolic scoring system has done a commendable job in ranking the models. The symbolic scores, based on the model's strengths and weaknesses, align well with the actual evaluation scores. For instance, the IForest model, which is well-suited for structured data, high skewness, and high kurtosis, was ranked first symbolically and performed second-best in actual evaluations. Similarly, the SO_GAAL model, which is strong in handling highly imbalanced data and high kurtosis, was ranked second symbolically and performed best in actual evaluations.

## Model Suitability Summary Table for CICIDS2017
The summary table provides a detailed comparison of the models based on various metrics. The SO_GAAL model outperforms all other models in terms of ROC AUC, average precision, accuracy, and F1 score for the minority class. The IForest model follows closely, ranking second in all these metrics. The other models, namely LUNAR, MO_GAAL, and LOF, lag behind in performance.

## Model Evaluation Heatmap for CICIDS2017
The heatmap further confirms the superiority of the SO_GAAL model, which shows the highest scores across all evaluation metrics. The IForest model also shows strong performance, especially in terms of accuracy and F1 score for the minority class.

## Analysis of Summary Table and Heatmap
The summary table and heatmap provide a clear picture of the model performances. The SO_GAAL model, despite its second place in symbolic ranking, outperforms all other models in actual evaluations. It excels in handling the high kurtosis and imbalance present in the CICIDS2017 dataset, making it the most suitable model for deployment.

## LLM Recommendations and Justification for Model Selection
Based on the symbolic scores, actual evaluation metrics, and the strengths of the models, the SO_GAAL model is recommended for deployment. Its strengths align well with the characteristics of the CICIDS2017 dataset, particularly its ability to handle highly imbalanced data and high kurtosis. The IForest model, while also a strong contender, falls slightly short in terms of performance metrics.

## Suggested Preprocessing Steps for CICIDS2017
Given the high skewness and kurtosis of the dataset, preprocessing steps such as log transformations or Box-Cox transformations could be beneficial. Feature scaling, such as Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling, could also be considered to ensure all features are on the same scale.

## Hyperparameter Tuning Recommendations
For the SO_GAAL model, hyperparameters such as the number of detectors and the size of the sliding window could be tuned to optimize performance. For the IForest model, the number of estimators and the contamination factor could be adjusted.

## Final Professional Recommendation
In conclusion, the SO_GAAL model is recommended for deployment on the CICIDS2017 dataset. Its strengths align well with the dataset's characteristics, and it outperforms all other models in actual evaluations. With appropriate preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, it is expected to provide reliable anomaly detection performance.
